# Notepages

This is the source code behind [notepag.es][0], a page site designed to allow quick, technical documents to be written online, without access to a LaTeX distribution or editor such as LyX. The main formatting of the documents is done in Markdown, and maths can be embedded using LaTeX format.

##Dependencies

Notepages is built upon [Node.js][1]/[MongoDB][2], and uses the [Grasshopper][3] and [Mongoose][4] libraries. Both libraries are available through `npm`. The server is expected to be run behind a webserver proxy (such as nginx), and for requests into the assets directory are served by the front end.

The database configuration is trivial and at the top of the `server.js` file. Running `node server.js` will start the server listening on port 8080.
